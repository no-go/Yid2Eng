    <string name="explain">For some characters you have to type a key two or three times.
Other characters needs a combination of the \'yellow\' keys: MELUPM, PASEKH, KOMETS, RAFE, DOT\n
\n
The \'red\' keys are a bit special: e.g. for a יִ you have to type the ייִ key, wait a bit
and then tap this key 2 times again to get the dot. For a ײַ you have to type the ייִ key 3 times and then
the PASEKH key.
